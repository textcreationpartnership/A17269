            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Theſe are the ſpeciall offendicles that I thought meet to lift out of the way, for preuenting the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of ſuch as are vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (without iuſt, and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent cauſe) to be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: and as for others that will needs be skipping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe blocks, when they may goe by them, let them knocke their ſheenes, and welcome.

               <p>THe <hi>firſt</hi> that comes to hand, is <hi>Virtue. Adde to your faith, Virtue.</hi> Somewhat muſt firſt bee ſpoken of the notation of the word, and then wee will deſcend vnto the thing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifies to make a free choyce of ſome excellent thing vpon mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that herein is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>excellency</hi> of the thing made choice of: that choice onely comes from vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which hath faſtened on ſome thing truly excellent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>free embracing</hi> of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19478:31"/>it by the will. Choice argues freedome of him that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. He that muſt be drawne by head and eares vnto any virtuous action, although he doe the worke, he is no virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>mature deliberation</hi> and aduice before the choice. He that doth by accident, or as it were by ſome ſudden ſtrong temptation, fall vpon ſome good worke, without mature deliberation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the worke; and of his duty to ſet about it, and doth not in conſcience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of performe it, is no virtuous man. Good turnes done in ſudden fits and humours, are no virtues in him that doth them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latine</hi> word is <hi>Virtus,</hi> ſome ſay, <hi>à viro;</hi> becauſe it is the property of humane nature to be <hi>virtuous,</hi> and he deſerues not the name of a man who is

                  </gap>, <hi>properly,</hi> for that which is <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>abuſiuely</hi> vſed is taken in a fourefold ſenſe:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo as we may ſay, there be foure ſorts of Patience, that are all counterfeit: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>ſinfull patience,</hi> which makes a man to beare what hee ought not. Whether it proceeds from lazineſſe and careleſneſſe, ſuffering himſelfe by lewd companie to be drawne on into the ſnares of the deuill, as the aſſe to the yoke without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or diſlike; which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Iohn Gerſon</hi> termed <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam aſininam,</hi> an <hi>Aſſe-like</hi> patience: or whether it come from a voluntarie reſolution to beare ſome things which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe impoſeth without any
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19478:69"/>command from God. Such is the patience of <hi>Baals Prieſts,</hi> and their <hi>Apes</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the one in <hi>launcing,</hi> the other in <hi>whipping</hi> of themſelues. This is <hi>hypocriticall</hi> Patience, which they haue borrowed from ſome <hi>Mountebanke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A Stoicall patience,</hi> which makes a man, out of an opinion that he ſhould be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, void of all paſſion, to ſhew himſelfe inſenſible of any thing that doth, or may befall him. This is no virtue, but a ſin that ſtocks vp naturall affections by the roots; and makes a man vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of profit by any croſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>cuſtomarie Patience,</hi> whereby a man long vſed to beare, is inſenſible of bearing. Like the bordering inhabitants of <hi>Nilus,</hi> who by long cuſtome are not moued at the hideous noiſe that the fall of that water makes, enough to aſtoniſh any other man. Or like ſome Mill-horſe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19478:70"/>that by long vſe, is not troubled at his drudging walke. This is not Patience, but a <hi>brawnie hardineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>naturall Patience,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man out of the ſtrength of bodie, or naturall conſtitution, is able to ſuffer many croſſes without ſinking vnder them. So yee ſhall haue ſome men that will draw faire eſtates through their throats, and lie at the <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,</hi> weeke after weeke, till all be ſpent, and runne ſo farre in debt, they cannot ſhew their heads; yet then can be as Iouiall as if they ailed no ſuch thing, and deſperately reſolue not to be moued at it: and if you aske them, why? they haue their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ready, <hi>Sorrow payes no debt;</hi> neuer thinking of Gods hand vpon them in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, which he requires them to behold, and to be humbled by it. Which, if they will not; he will proceed to bring vpon
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19478:70"/>them more, &amp; greater plagues, vntill he hath deſtroyed them. This ſenſeleſneſſe of men is farre from true Patience. It is only <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>

               <p n="1">1. The firſt part of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie herein, is to labour for that Patience which is a Grace of the Spirit; not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with <hi>Sinfull, Stoicall, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomarie,</hi> or <hi>Naturall</hi> Patience, falſly ſo called.

               <p>The ends of Chriſtians ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, therefore, muſt be theſe.</p>

<note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.16</note>.

<note n="i" place="margin">Heſt. 4.16.</note>.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

It is of excellent vſe to helpe vs gaine experience, and profit by affliction: which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to get that wants patience. Though God intends that euery affliction ſhould make vs better, yet impatient men are made worſe. If a man be once troubled, he is off the hooks for any thing, although he take neuer ſo much delight in doing of it.

Patience is as a paring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife that cuts the affliction leſſe and leſſe till it comes to nothing: whereas impatience is like a loadſtone, that drawes more weight vnto it; and like birdlime, that hangs vs faſter in the ſnare. An impatient man is <hi>like a wilde bull in a net</hi>

Affliction fals on a patient man, as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſtorme of haile vpon a well-tiled houſe, that makes a great ratling noiſe without, but does no hurt, nor gets into any roome within: a man may as freely vſe any roome in that

               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:19478:83"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient man bee rid of his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fury, and become <hi>patient?</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I muſt commend againe the former helpe of prayer, without which no grace can be had; therefore in praier of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten arraigne, and condemne thy paſſion freely, and fully in the preſence of God, and ſhame thy ſelfe to the vtmoſt of thy power in confeſſing thy ſinne, and earneſtly deſire him to doe execution vpon it, that ſo thou maiſt be rid of this peſtilent fret of anger: neuer leaue it out in any of thy praiers, but rather take occaſion from this to make many praiers the more vnto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Get out of the company of impatient men: For, as all hot diſeaſes, the more hot they be, the more infection they ſpread:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19478:83"/>ſo is the diſeaſe of impatience very infectious, and as catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the plague.

               <p>As for ſuch Chriſtians as haue beene hindred by any meanes, and not ſhewed ſuch bounty as the caſe and cauſe required, they ſhould doe well to raiſe vp themſelues to a higher degree of liberalitie, and thinke of ſome meanes to

                  <hi>Brotherly-kindneſſe</hi> dwells no where, but in puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hearts. Looke what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and malice the lewd wretches of the world, and heires of hell doe daily belch out againſt the brethren: the ſame would we doe alſo, if our hearts were not purified from that naturall malice that is within vs all, againſt all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. There is no louing of one another <hi>feruently,</hi> vntill wee haue gotten <hi>pure hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Labour daily to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend more fully the <hi>exceeding
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19478:117"/>greatneſſe of the loue of God</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelues. For this will the more enlarge vs to others. He that findes any great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage extraordinarie kinde, will giue a great deale the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his ſeruants about him, eſpecially ſuch as watch all opportunities to doe him any good office to their Lord. Experience tells vs, that no Chriſtians haue ſo large hearts, &amp; ſuch bowels of compaſſion, as they in whom <hi>the loue of God</hi> is moſt plentifully <hi>ſhed.</hi> As the pot muſt firſt be throughly heated, before it will cauſe the liquor within it, to boyle: ſo our hearts muſt firſt bee throughly warmed by the ſenſe of Gods loue to our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our loue, and bountie will runne ouer to others.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Be not ouer-curious in ſearching our the infirmities, and corruptions of <hi>brethren,</hi> but rather mantle them with

He that hath an open eare to euery tale that is carried, of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, may hope to loue them when he comes to heauen, (if euer he come there) but not before. The way to loue, is to paſſe ouer infirmities of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to admoniſh him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly without any after repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So ſaith the Wiſeman from the Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: <hi>He that couereth a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ſeeketh loue; but he that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth very friends</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19478:118"/>ſhould not know, is an odious perſon to all his neighbours: and the Towne he liues in, longs for a <hi>vomit</hi> to ſpew him out.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Spend the time of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more profitably then men vſe to doe. If men will trifle out a large portion of time in idle prate, and not ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to incourage, and whet, and <hi>prouoke one another to loue and to good workes,</hi> no maruell they be no more louing.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19478:118"/>This is iuſt with God, that when men <hi>come together ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the worſe then the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> he ſhould diſcouer their backbitings, and ſmite them with vnbrotherly diuiſions, that may hinder their meeting at all.

                  <hi>Charitie</hi> taken <hi>largely,</hi> is that <hi>Theologicall Virtue</hi> (as they call it) whereby we loue God for himſelfe, aboue all, and all others for God, and in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charitie</hi> taken <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> is vſed in a threefold ſenſe. 1. For that part of charitie, which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in workes of mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that be in miſerie
<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 6.10.</note>. 2. For that ſpeciall meaſure of affection which is borne vnto the <hi>godly</hi>

               </p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:19478:120"/>
               <p>In this place it cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>Loue</hi> in the <hi>largeſt</hi> ſenſe:
<note place="margin">How Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is taken here.</note> becauſe it is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from <hi>brotherly-kindneſſe.</hi> Nor can it be taken for <hi>charitie</hi> towards the <hi>godly;</hi> for <hi>they</hi> are the proper obiect of <hi>brotherly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe.</hi> Therefore it muſt needs be taken for <hi>Charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men,</hi> conſidered as men, and capable of happineſſe as well as our ſelues; perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all workes of mercy and charitie that their neceſſities require. Hence obſerue:</p>

                  </label> 
                  <hi>as much as to himſelfe. Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> If thou demand; <hi>But who is my neighbour?</hi> Our Lord himſelfe put the anſwer into his mouth, who firſt made the queſtion: not only thoſe that dwell the next doore to vs, or in the ſame Pariſh; but all men <hi>created in the image of God,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19478:120"/>they dwell in <hi>India.</hi> The <hi>wounded man,</hi> our Sauiour ſpeakes of, was a meere ſtranger to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> that <hi>ſhewed him mercy;</hi> and he chargeth all <hi>to goe and doe likewiſe</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Luke 10.</note>. To which agrees the Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Doe good vnto all</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note>.</p>
               <p>And leſt we ſhould imagine our Sauiours charge not to be vniuerſall; hee leaues not our very <hi>enemies</hi> without the range of our charitie; but thus expounds the Law: <hi>Yee haue heard that it hath beene ſaid, thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour, and hate thine enemie.</hi> Who ſaid ſo? Not God, but the blinde Phariſies, who tooke vpon them to be <hi>teachers of the Law, vnderſtanding neither what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed.</hi> Therefore our Lord expungeth this falſe Gloſſe, and thus inſerts the minde of the Law-giuer: <hi>But I ſay vnto you, loue your enemies.</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:19478:121"/>And leſt wee ſhould thinke, that diſſembled wordie loue were enough, he adds; <hi>Bleſſe them that curſe you; doe good to them that hate you; and pray for them which deſpightfully vſe you, and perſecute you</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Matth. 5.43, 44.</note>. In theſe words <hi>Synecdochically</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that all things <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer wee would that men ſhould doe vnto vs, the ſame we ſhould doe vnto them; for this is the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Matt. 7.12.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thus haue wee ſeene that none muſt be excluded our charitie. But now wee muſt further ſee what this <hi>extenſiue charitie</hi> includeth in it. Vpon ſuruey, I finde that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs two things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An vnfained <hi>deſire and prayer to God that they might be ſaued</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 10.1.</note>. Loue being a well-willing affection, muſt will the chiefeſt good, or elſe it is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19478:121"/>not perfect loue: and this not only from the teeth, but the heart. <hi>How can we ſay, we loue them, when our heart is not with them</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Iudg. 16.15.</note>?</p>
               <p n="2">2. An earneſt endeuour to procure them all the good their neceſſitie requires; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they loue vs, or hate vs. For though <hi>they hate vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe,</hi> yet we are neuer without a cauſe to ſeeke their good, becauſe they are of the ſame nature with vs. Therefore remember our Sauiours iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>Doe good to them that hate you.</hi> And that in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In labouring their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion to <hi>ſaue their ſoules from death</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Iam. 5.19, 20.</note>; which to neglect, were a moſt bloudie part of a cruell <hi>murderer</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.15.</note>. He that ſhould ſee a man going into ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous place, being bound to giue warning of the danger to all that paſſe by him, and yet
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19478:122"/>neglect it; would be iudged of all men to be guiltie of his bloud, that for want of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ranne vpon his ruine. Of what great ſinne are they then guilty of, that can ſuffer many ſoules to paſſe along by them to hell, and neuer take paines to tell them of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and diuert their courſe! How will men cry out to one that vnwittingly, or deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rides into ſome deepe riuer, or quick-ſands! How ſilent are they to them that gallop vpon the ſpeed to damnation!</p>
               <p n="2">2. In cheerefull adminiſtring to their neceſſities, without difference of friends, or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>If thine enemie hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, giue him drinke</hi>
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ro. 12.20.</note>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In preſeruing them from all manner dammage in their eſtates. <hi>If thou meeteſt thine enemies Oxe, or Aſſe going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19478:122"/>backe to him againe. If thou ſee the Aſſe of him that hateth thee, lying vnder his burden, and wouldſt forbeare to helpe him, thou ſhalt ſurely helpe him</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Exod. 23.5, 6.</note>.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

<note n="u" place="margin">Matth 18.15, 16, 17, 18.</note>. This may well ſtand with true and feruent loue. The father cannot be accuſed for want of loue to his ſonne when he <hi>corrects</hi> him; not <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſoule ſpare for his cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Yea it were <hi>hatred, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſinne vpon him,</hi> for want of <hi>rebuke,</hi> and correction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In whatſoeuer other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we can performe, according

               <p>And that this may no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeeme a ſtrange or harſh doctrine to any; I will in the next place propound ſundry grounds of the equitie, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of louing, 1. All men in generall. 2. Our enemies in particular.</p>

               <p n="2">2. We are all bound to come as neere vnto God as poſſibly we can, and <hi>to learne of him</hi>

                  </gap>, or <hi>naturall affection</hi> vnto Parents, that no man muſt bee without, vnleſſe he will be <hi>impious.</hi> So there is by mariage ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination not onely of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but of hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that <hi>a man muſt for this cauſe, forſake father and mother, and cleaue to his wife</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 2.24.</note>: and that wife that eſtrangeth or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth

               <p>Wee muſt therefore diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of <hi>loue,</hi> which in reſpect of the <hi>ground,</hi> may bee termed either <hi>Naturall,</hi> or <hi>Spirituall: Naturall,</hi> is that entire affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and valuation of ſuch as God hath knit vs neere vnto by the bonds of <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugall ſocietie.

A man may loue a gratious man, as a gratious man, more then him that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious; but one may not loue a gratious man better then a husband or a wife conſidered in theſe relations: becauſe if a man haue neuer ſo much grace that is further off, another mans wife may not loue him

And ſo a maried man may not loue a gracious woman that is not his wife, with that deareneſſe of affection, which he is to beſtow on his wife, as his wife. The reaſon is, becauſe <hi>grace</hi> doth not teach vs to neglect or breake any <hi>Couenant of God,</hi> but rather ſtabliſh it, and ſtirre vs vp to keepe it with more fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
               <p>Briefly wee may conclude it thus.

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> to loue <hi>all men,</hi> as well <hi>enemies,</hi> as friends; it is then a great fault among vs that we are ſo farre from this dutie, that ſcarce any doe in good earneſt beleeue themſelues bound vnto it.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19478:136"/>and railing at thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.

               <p>There be others of ſuch a ſowre, ſullen, dogged diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they can loue no man heartily, but themſelues.

               <p>Nay it were well that many were not much worſe then thoſe <hi>Publicans,</hi> (whom our Sauiour vpbraided) and did not refuſe to <hi>loue thoſe that

How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is it for men to miſtake friends for foes, and foes for friends; and to vndoe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by thoſe they beſtow moſt loue vpon: like thoſe that beſtow a great deale of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hot water vpon a <hi>dropſie</hi> that will be ſure to kill them: and all becauſe they loue not any, in conſcience of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they owe vnto God, but only for by-reſpects.</p>
               <p>Haue wee not many that thinke it an impoſſible, and vnreaſonable taske, to <hi>loue an enemie?</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">What? loue him that daily railes at them with ſuch bitterneſſe, as if hee had beene as farre as hell for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that tumbles out of his mouth againſt them, and doth them all the ſpight and miſchiefe hee can poſſible worke them?

               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that there is none of vs all, but would be
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19478:140"/>glad to be loued of all the men in the world, if we could bring it to paſſe. Now what reaſon can we haue to expect this, when we are reſolued to loue but a few?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remember that we daily treſpaſſe againſt God, more then any can treſpaſſe againſt vs. And we looke that God ſhould, for all this, loue and forgiue vs, and thinke neuer the worſe of vs. But tis in vaine to expect this at the hands of God, vnleſſe we doe the like to our enemies. Our <hi>Sauiour</hi> hath <hi>often</hi> auoucht it, leſt any man ſhould thinke, hee will be better then his word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider that it often happens, that one cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie falls at one time or other into the hands of another, on whom he hath powred moſt contempt. As we ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi> falling often into <hi>Dauids</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:19478:140"/>power: And daily examples of men that come within the reach of their greateſt enemies, that may doe them moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; and then if they could not formerly finde in their hearts to loue them, it were vnreaſonable to expect their fauour, and baſe to deſire it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider that while wee loue not our enemies, we haue another at our powles, that does vs more miſchiefe then all the reſt. The deuill would aske no better aduantage then to ſettle a man in this vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table humour. For then hee knowes it an eaſie matter to worke him to any villanie whatſoeuer.

He that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes his enemie with loue, will ſtill get ground of him, doe what he can for his heart; and beare away the honour, in the eyes of all that looke on.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly conſider: He that loues an enemie ſhall draw a greater reuenge vpon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, by his loue, (if his enemie notwithſtanding his loue, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19478:141"/>in his enmitie) then hee could poſſibly doe by any other meanes.

               <p>Yea the way to load a perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting enemie with vengeance is to loue him with all our hearts. For this will bring <hi>the coles of fire vpon his head</hi> by <hi>heapes</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Verſ. 20.</note>. And take this to the
